The Mlem iOS developers are aware that the terms of service that apply to apps distributed via Apple's App Store services may conflict with rights granted under
the Mlem iOS license, the "GNU GPLv3 amended by the Commons Clause v1". We have committed not to pursue any license violation that results solely from the conflict between
the "GNU GPLv3 amended by the Commons Clause v1" or any later version and the Apple App Store terms of service.
